# Game of Life Simulation

Conways Game of Life simulation. Outputs each stage of the simulation as an image. The rules of the simulation are: 
Each grid cell can be in one of two possible states: live or dead
 
(1) Any live cell with zero or one neighbors dies, as if by solitude.
(2) Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on
(3) Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding
(4) Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction
